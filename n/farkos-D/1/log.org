* farkos-D flight 1: science check

This flight used only the top bit of the stack down through science
to verify that we can run experiments, and transfer results back to
storge, without a scientist kerbal going EVA.

The vessel was recovered with about 11 science collected from the
launchpad.

Mission Successful.

Farkos-D/2 mission

* Mission Goals

- Able to carry a Tourist
- Able to collect Science
- Launch to Space
- Establish circular orbit
- Return from Space
- Land Safely
- Repeatable

* Build Checklist

- [X] upgrade astronaut complex to level 2 (eva, flags)
- [X] upgrade launchpad to level 2 (36m, 140t)
- [ ] upgrade VAB to level 2 (more than 30 parts)

- [X] Engine(s) and fuel for launch and ascent (~2000 m/s)
- [X] Engine(s) and fuel for circularization (~1000 m/s)
- [X] Engine(s) and fuel for deorbit (~100 m/s)
- [X] Engine(s) and fuel for deceleration (optional)
- [X] Science Experiments present
- [X] kOS Command Processor
- [X] Command Capsule
  - [X] Separator
  - [X] Heat Shield
  - [X] Crew Cabin (pilot + tourist)
- [X] Science Storage (clip into capsule)
- [X] Parachute (stage WITH the capsule separator!)

Note: when we trigger separtion at the capsule, we lose our kOS core,
so we must trigger the parachute at that time. So we can't discard
our descent stage until we are ready to activate the parachute.

* Mission Plan

- [ ] Launch phase through clearing the grantry
- [ ] Ascend along a pitch program
- [ ] Coast to Apoapsis
- [ ] Circularize Orbit

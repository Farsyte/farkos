Code Style tweaked for VS Code "folding" feature

For reasons, I am attempting to "daily drive" Microsft VS Code, and
it provides code folding to hide the contents of blocks of code. This
facility will collapse blocks in curly-braces {} which is very nice
for folding away details.

However, this motivates a style change. My preferred brace style is
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language:

        function foo { parameter x.     // apply the foo formula to x
            local var is x+1.
            return var*var.
        }

        function bar { parameter x.     // apply the bar formula to x
            local var is x+1.
            return var*var.
        }

However, VS Code leaves the close braces outside the fold, which
results in this display:

    >   function foo { parameter x.     // apply the foo formula to x
        }

    >   function bar { parameter x.     // apply the bar formula to x
        }

Now, I'm probably folding a file so I can see what functions it
contains (or other similar things), and this takes up three lines
of display. It turns out that if we pull the close-brace up to the
end of the prior line,


        function foo { parameter x.     // apply the foo formula to x
            local var is x+1.
            return var*var. }

        function bar { parameter x.     // apply the bar formula to x
            local var is x+1.
            return var*var. }

the folded display looks like this:

    >   function foo { parameter x.     // apply the foo formula to x
    >   function bar { parameter x.     // apply the bar formula to x

This is much more in keeping with the idea of dropping unwanted
details to expose the overall view; note that not only does it fold
away the close brace, it folds away the blank lines that follow it.

# Stand-Alone Scripts

Files in this directory are intended to stand alone, to be
runnable directly from a boot script with support from outside
this directory (I must admit the possibility of things being
placed here that use multiple files).

Currently, I've placed some automatic staging code here that
has been shared on Reddit r/kos, which includes some features
suggested by Nuggreat.

I have in my head the idea that I could pick out certain other
specific bits of code that I can make stand-alone, and which
might be useful in isolation to others.

This is my way of admitting that the/pkg and /home areas in this
repo are a mix of interesting ideas and hot-mess-hackery ;)
